Synthetic Handwriting Data

HandPD and PC-GITA datasets require institutional access.
For this implementation, we generate synthetic handwriting data
that simulates tremor patterns and motor control variations.

The synthetic data generator creates:
- Spiral drawing tasks
- Handwriting stroke sequences
- Tremor frequency analysis
- Motor control metrics

This allows the system to demonstrate multi-modal fusion
without requiring access to restricted datasets.
